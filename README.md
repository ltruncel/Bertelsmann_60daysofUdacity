# Bertelsmann 60 Days of Udacity Challenge 

This is my daily journey for the 60 day learning challenge of the Bertelsmann Data Track Scholarship with Udacity where I pledged to code and work through my Foundations course content for at least 30 minutes every day. I began on December 10, 2020.


## Day 1

:cherry_blossom: I made the pledge and reviewed lesson 1. Let's start! <br>
:cherry_blossom: The core of this lesson is the problem solving framework, which involves the understanding of business issues and data, data preparation, modeling, validation, and visualization. <br>

## Day 2
:cherry_blossom: I completed the first half of Lesson 2. It began with the methodology map, which helps to determine the right methodology for a variety of business problems. <br>
