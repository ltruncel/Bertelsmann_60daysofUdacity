# Bertelsmann 60 Days of Udacity Challenge 

### This is my daily journey for the 60 day learning challenge of the Bertelsmann Data Track Scholarship with Udacity where I pledged to code and work through my Foundations course content for at least 30 minutes every day. I began on December 10, 2020. <br>

## Day 1

:cherry_blossom: I made the pledge and reviewed lesson 1. Let's start! <br>
:cherry_blossom: The core of this lesson is the problem solving framework, which involves the understanding of business issues and data, data preparation, modeling, validation, and visualization. <br>

## Day 2
:cherry_blossom: I completed the first half of Lesson 2. It began with the methodology map, which helps to determine the right methodology for a variety of business problems. <br>
:cherry_blossom: Non-Predictive Analysis has four categories: Geospatial, Segmentation, Aggregation, and Descriptive. <br>
:cherry_blossom: Predictive business problems can be data rich or data poor. <br>
:cherry_blossom: If there is not sufficient usable data to solve the problem, we'll need to set up an experiment to help us get the data we need, which is called the A/B Test. <br>
:cherry_blossom: There's more to it. Stay tuned for my updates tomorrow!
