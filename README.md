# Bertelsmann 60 Days of Udacity Challenge 

### This is a record of my 60-day learning challenge for the Bertelsmann Data Track Scholarship where I pledged to code and work through my Foundations course content for at least 30 minutes every day. I began on December 10, 2020. <br>

## Day 1 - 12.10.20

:cherry_blossom: I made the pledge and reviewed lesson 1. Let's start! <br>

:cherry_blossom: The core of this lesson is the problem solving framework, which involves the understanding of business issues and data, data preparation, modeling, validation, and visualization. <br>

## Day 2 - 12.11.20

:cherry_blossom: I completed the first half of Lesson 2. It began with the methodology map, which helps to determine the right methodology for a variety of business problems. <br>

:cherry_blossom: Non-Predictive Analysis has four categories: Geospatial, Segmentation, Aggregation, and Descriptive. <br>

:cherry_blossom: Predictive business problems can be data rich or data poor. <br>

:cherry_blossom: If there is not sufficient usable data to solve the problem, we'll need to set up an experiment to help us get the data we need, which is called the A/B Test. <br>

:cherry_blossom: There's more to it. Stay tuned for my updates tomorrow!

## Day 3 - 12.12.20

:cherry_blossom: Today I began with the data rich problems. There are two types of data-rich problems, numeric and non-numeric, depending on the desired outcomes.<br>  
  - Models predicting numeric outcomes are called regression models.
  - Models predicting non-numeric outcomes are classification models.<br>
  

:cherry_blossom: Numeric models can be continuous, time-based, or count: <br>

:cherry_blossom: Non-numeric models can be binary or non-binary.<br>

:cherry_blossom: I also completed the quizzes at the end of the lesson and thus concluded Lesson 2.


## Day 4 - 12.13.20 

:cherry_blossom: I began Lesson 3 by analyzing a business problem, where we need to determine whether we have enough capacity on the support team to handle the support tickets from the new customer, and if not, how many people we would need to add to reach the desired capacity.  The steps to analyze the problem are as follows: 

1. Is this a data rich, or data poor problem?
2. Should we use a numeric or classification model?
3. Is our target variable continuous or time-based? 

The answer to this problem is that we should use a continuous model.

:cherry_blossom: I also completed the unit about linear regression.

## Day 5 - 12.14.20 

:cherry_blossom: I continue to work on the unit about linear regression. We can use a simple Google sheet to calculate slope and interception to learn about the relation of x and y. To know whether the linear expression we calculated a good fit of our data, we use the correlation function CORREL(data_y, data_x) to calculate the correlation r between the target and predictor variable. The range of r is from -1 to +1. The closer r is to plus or minus 1, the higher the correlation between x and y. <br>

:cherry_blossom: In addition to know how well the data fits our line. we would also want to know how good the formula is at approximating the data by calculating the coefficient of determination, or r-squared. R-squared is a coefficient between 0 and 1.
- closer to 1: nearly all variance in the target variable is explained by the model
- closer to 0: nearly none of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
