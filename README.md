# Bertelsmann 60 Days of Udacity Challenge 

This is my daily journey for the 60 day learning challenge of the Bertelsmann Data Track Scholarship where I pledged to code and/or work through my Foundations course content for at least 30 minutes every day.


## Day 1
:cherry_blossom: I made the pledge and reviewed lesson 1. The core of this lesson is the problem solving framework, which involves the understanding of business issues and data, data preparation, modeling, validation, and visualization. Hope everyone is joining in the challenge! Encouraging @susyjam @Frida! :sparkling_heart:
