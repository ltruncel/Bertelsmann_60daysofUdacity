# Bertelsmann 60 Days of Udacity Challenge 

This is my daily journey for the 60 day learning challenge of the Bertelsmann Data Track Scholarship where I pledged to code and work through my Foundations course content for at least 30 minutes every day. I began on December 10, 2020.


## Day 1
:cherry_blossom: I made the pledge and reviewed lesson 1. Let's start! 
:cherry_blossom: The core of this lesson is the problem solving framework, which involves the understanding of business issues and data, data preparation, modeling, validation, and visualization. 
:cherry_blossom: Hope everyone is joining in the challenge! Encouraging @susyjam @Frida! :sparkling_heart:
